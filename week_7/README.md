# Week 7
Understand how to use Ray Tune, a scalable framework for searching for hyperparameters.

- Use Tune to reduce one of the most expensive parts of machine learning
- Search for the right parameters, such as learning rate and momentum, to train a neural network
- Combine HyperOpt and HyperBand to perform a more powerful search
